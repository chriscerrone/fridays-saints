# Python script for generating .txt files

This script is for using a google sheet like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VDwPe9hKSHXVEZSls5vFoe_vihTM-lGpmwxSjNe8wNI/edit?usp=sharing) to generate the .txt files for the step sequencer, the automated sample playback, and audio effects.

To set up the python environment, open a terminal on your mac computer and enter the following commands:

The very first time:
```
cd /path/to/project/

cd python/lib

python3 -m venv .

source bin/activate

pip install requests
```
all subsequent times:
```
cd /path/to/project/python/lib

source bin/activate

cd everything
```
Now, in order to run the script, enter:
```
python _genAllStepFiles.py
```
This will generate all the relevant files, and save all the old files into an archive folder. A successful run should look like this:
```
(python) bse@bse-mbp everything % python _genAllStepFiles.py
